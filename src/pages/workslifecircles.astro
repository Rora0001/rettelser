  <h1>LIFE CIRCLES</h1>

  <Workscomponent1 text="Perfect imperfect circle" describtion="Life Circle is a project I have been working on since 2014. This artwork emerged during a period in my life when I was experiencing a creative block. Without a set plan, I began to create line drawings, drawing lines in circles. This process evolved into a form of meditative practice for me,  which has now developed into an ongoing project and a deeper connection with myself. Many people have told me that they experience a special peace and meditative state when they look at the circles in the painting. The work resonates in a unique way with viewers, creating a sense of peace and inner tranquility" imageSrc="public/billeder/lifecircles/lifecircles1.jpg" />

  <Workscomponent2 text="The map of the amazing female body and the phases it undergoes. When the female body and mind feel weak, I remember what it has endured and achieved. Birth, puberty, giving life, losing life, illness, shock, happiness, trauma, balance, imbalanceâ€”a life fully lived." />
